# TIL

> Today I Learned

This folder contains small write-ups of useful things that I might come across or discover in any given day. Usually this will be something technology-oriented, but it does not have to be. These entries are supposed to be short by design, and do not hold enough content to warrant a full post somewhere else.

Check out other _TIL_ repositories like those by [jbranchaud](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til), [jwworth](https://github.com/jwworth/til), and [thoughtbot](https://github.com/thoughtbot/til) whom I have borrowed ideas from.
