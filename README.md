This is a repository to track all of my ongoing projects, research, thoughts, work, code, etc. Some of it may be useful to you, most of it will likely be nonsense. This will hopefully replace, open browser tabs, Google Docs, Pocket, Trello, Evernote, Any.do, text files, wiki pages, and good old fashioned paper, creating one unified place for all of my notes.

## Tasks

Let's start with a *task list*. This will list key things I'm working on, coupled with the date they were added to the list (not necessarily the date that I started working on them, but that may be used if I can find it). This will be used to track how long a project has been open. Tasks will move to **completed** when they have been finished.
